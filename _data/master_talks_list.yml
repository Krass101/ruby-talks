  talk_title: The Past, Present, and Future of Rails at GitHub
  talk_description: 'On August 15, 2018 GitHub accomplished a great feat: upgrading
    our application from Rails 3.2 to 5.2. While this upgrade took a difficult year
    and a half your upgrade doesn''t need to be this hard. In this talk we''ll look
    at ways in which our upgrade was uniquely hard, how we accomplished this monumental
    task, and what we''re doing to prevent hard upgrades in the future. We''ll take
    a deep dive into why we upgraded Rails and our plans for upstreaming features
    from the GitHub application into the Rails framework.'

  talk_title: Parallel and Thread-Safe Ruby at High-Speed with TruffleRuby
  talk_description: Array and Hash are used in every Ruby program, but current implementations
    either prevent to use them in parallel (MRI) or lack thread-safety guarantees
    (JRuby raises on concurrent Array#«). We show how to make Array and Hash thread-safe
    while allowing Ruby collections to scale up to tens of cores!

  talk_description: With more applications now using service-oriented architectures,
    developers must know how to talk to distributed technologies and to handle errors
    and failures. While you can usually depend on libraries to encapsulate such details,
    it's important to understand and to be able to predict the behavior of your distributed
    systems. This talk will arm you with algorithms and testing strategies so you
    can tame your services and build robust applications.

    collectors, so let’s take a look at Ruby’s GC! In this talk we’ll walk through
    how Ruby allocates objects, then talk about how we can optimize object layout
    and memory usage via compaction. Finally we’ll take a look at how to actually
    build a compacting GC for Ruby as well as the interesting challenges that can
